            <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto">My name is Lucas Fernandes, I'm 22 years old and I'm looking for an opportunity to grow as a person and as a professional in this great area. I'm from Rio de Janeiro, more specifically from the city of Itatiaia, in the Sul-Fluminense region. I moved to Curitiba a few months ago in search of greater opportunities to start my career as a developer, in order to learn and develop my knowledge in the area, while contributing to the company in the best way I can. I really like the area and I'm very eager to learn more and achieve important things for my professional progression.
            </p>

            <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto">I have a degree in Information Systems from Estácio de Sá, and in Front-end Development from the dear Alura who has helped me so much and taught me a lot in the last few months. This is not my first HTML project but it is certainly the most completed, which I believe is fully in accordance with the quality standards and good practices that a good project deserves. And of course, I will always be developing new projects and adding them to my portfolio, both on GitHub and on Linkedin itself.
